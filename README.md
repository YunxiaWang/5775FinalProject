# Handwritten-Mathematical-Expression-Recognition-and-Calculation
Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition and Calculation (Nov. 2015 - Dec. 2015)  
1. Designed a C++ application (LINUX OS) recognizing math expression written in one row based on KNN algorithm.  
2. Implemented Seam Carving and directly scaling algorithm to process bitmap images and training data.  
3. Accelerated recognizing runtime using high-level synthesis and FPGA.
